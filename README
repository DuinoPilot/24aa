Abstraction layer for EEPROM ICs like 24AA/24LC.

1. DESCRIPTION

This library designed to work on top of ChibiOS/RT. It abstracts access to
EEPROM like a regular file(s).

2. LIMITATIONS

* Only I2C.
* Maximum capacity of EEPROM is 65536 bytes.

3. USAGE

* Include eeprom.h file to your project.
* Define file object of a EepromFileStream type
  and config structure for it.
* Open them with EepromOpen() function.

Now you can access to EEPROM array like to a regular file with functions:
- chFileStreamRead()
- chFileStreamWrite()
- chFileStreamGetPosition()
- chFileStreamSeek()
etc. 

Examples of usage and checking the returning parameter you can found in
eeprom_testsuit.c
